hd2-calc
========

Overview
========
Calculator strapped into the ever-hackable HTC HD2.

Software
========
This is essentially a gui and glue to connect maxima (main target)
and octave (Would be nice) to a touch friendly gui to be used on the
htc hd2 with a custom keyboard (TODO) over usb OTG.

Dependencies
============
*   python (3.3)
*   pyside
*   maxima
*   octave

Special Notes
=============
Need to pin tslib (unstable), xorg (stable) so updating doesn't kill things.
(Using squeeze because it's old, but testing has python3.3, which I want to try.)

Setup instructions will come soon...
